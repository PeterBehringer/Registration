# Workflow overview

The workflow consists of the two main steps: preparation of the biopsy plan and intra-procedural tracking of the biopsy targets.

**Preparation step** is concerned with the processing of the multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) obtained prior to the biopsy procedure. It includes segmentation of the prostate gland, correction of the intensity inhomogeneity (if endorectal coil was used during image acquisition), and identification of the biopsy targets.

**Intra-procedural tracking**
