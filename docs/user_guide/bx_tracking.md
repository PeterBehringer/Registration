# Intra-procedural tracking of targets

Intra-procedural phase of the workflow is driven by the intra-procedural image data. The sequence of processing steps and the corresponding types of image series is the following:
1. Z-frame calibration: in this step, z-frame device attached to the transperineal biopsy template is registered with the coordinate frame of the scanner.
2. Registration of the pre-procedural T2-weighted series to the intra-procedural imaging and re-identification of the planned target locations.
3. Tracking of the biopsy targets in the needle confirmation scans and visualization of the needle path.
