Prostate  cancer  (PCa)  remains  a  leading  cause  of  cancer  mortality  in 
the  USA  andworldwide [1]. A critical question in management of PCa is in 
distinguishing aggressive cancer from indolent disease. Characterization of tumor 
aggressiveness relies on histo‐pathological analysis of biopsy samples [2]. In 
the recent years, targeted sampling ofsuspected  cancer  areas  have  emerged  
as  an  effective  personalized  alternative  to  the systematic sextant biopsy 
[3]. Such targeted approaches require multiparametric MRI(mpMRI)  for  localizing  
suspected  regions,  which  are  then  re-identified  by  means  ofimage 
registration in the intra-procedural imaging. MRI can also be used as the 
intra-procedural  imaging  modality,  as  it  provides  superior  visualization 
of  the  needle,anatomy  and  suspicious  regions  [4].  However,  prostate  
motion  during  the  course  ofbiopsy, which can last for over an hour for 
in-bore procedures, can complicate locali‐zation of the suspected lesion. 
Continuous tracking of the prostate may thus be requiredto enable accurate targeting.
